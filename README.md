# GOVERN OBERT
## Descobrint la Generalitat

Here you can finde the code used to make sense of the open data published by the government of Catalunya.

It is used to build http://opengov.cat - please find more information about the project on the website.

This repository is slightly organized: 

  - data - csv, json and xml files
  - m.virtel.de - the very parts of the project hosted at my personal blog, http://m.virtel.de
  - opengov.cat - visualizations used on opengov.cat
  - py - python scraper code
